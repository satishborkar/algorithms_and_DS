## Computational Geometry Algorithms

Computational geometry algorithms are algorithms used to solve problems related to geometric objects in computational settings. These algorithms deal with various geometric problems, such as geometric transformations, geometric intersection, convex hulls, triangulations, and proximity queries. Here are some commonly used computational geometry algorithms:

1. Convex Hull:

   - Convex hull algorithms compute the smallest convex polygon that contains a set of points in the plane.
   - Examples include the Graham's scan algorithm, Jarvis march, and Quickhull algorithm.
   - Widely used in areas such as image processing, computer graphics, and computational geometry.

2. Line Intersection:

   - Algorithms for determining whether and where two lines or line segments intersect.
   - Examples include the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm for intersecting line segments and the sweep line algorithm for intersecting lines.
   - Used in applications such as computer graphics, collision detection, and computational geometry.

3. Triangulation:

   - Triangulation algorithms partition a set of points into triangles, forming a mesh.
   - Common algorithms include Delaunay triangulation, Ear clipping, and Bowyer-Watson algorithm.
   - Used in computational geometry, computer graphics, and mesh generation.

4. Voronoi Diagram:

   - Voronoi diagrams partition a plane into regions based on the distance to a set of points.
   - Algorithms for constructing Voronoi diagrams include Fortune's algorithm and incremental construction methods.
   - Widely used in spatial analysis, computer graphics, and proximity-based algorithms.

5. Range Searching:

   - Range searching algorithms find points or objects within a specified range or region.
   - Examples include k-d trees, range trees, and quad trees.
   - Used in applications such as spatial databases, image processing, and computational geometry.

6. Geometric Transformation:

   - Algorithms for transforming geometric objects, such as translation, rotation, scaling, and affine transformations.
   - Used in computer graphics, computer vision, and geometric modeling.

7. Visibility Determination:
   - Algorithms for determining the visible parts of objects from a given viewpoint or for computing visibility polygons.
   - Examples include the visibility graph algorithm and the hidden surface removal algorithms.
   - Important in computer graphics, robot motion planning, and virtual reality applications.

These are just a few examples of computational geometry algorithms, and there are numerous other algorithms and techniques developed to solve specific geometric problems. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the problem, the complexity of the geometric objects, and the efficiency and accuracy requirements.
