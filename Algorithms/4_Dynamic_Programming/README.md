## Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Dynamic Programming is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. Here are some commonly used Dynamic Programming algorithms:

1. Fibonacci Sequence:

   - Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. It stores the intermediate results in an array or memoization table to improve efficiency.

2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):

   - Finds the longest subsequence that two sequences have in common. It uses a dynamic programming table to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences of prefixes of the sequences.

3. Knapsack Problem:

   - Determines the optimal selection of items to include in a knapsack, given their weights and values, to maximize the total value while not exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity. It uses dynamic programming to find the optimal solution.

4. Matrix Chain Multiplication:

   - Determines the most efficient way to multiply a series of matrices. It uses dynamic programming to find the optimal parenthesization of the matrices, minimizing the number of scalar multiplications required.

5. Coin Change Problem:

   - Finds the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change. It uses dynamic programming to build a table of the minimum number of coins required for each possible amount.

6. Edit Distance:

   - Calculates the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one string into another. It uses dynamic programming to fill a table with the minimum edit distances between substrings.

7. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):

   - Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array. It uses dynamic programming to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences of prefixes of the array.

8. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
   - Determines the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. It uses dynamic programming to solve smaller subproblems and build up to the optimal solution.

These are some examples of Dynamic Programming algorithms. The key idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them, and store the results in a table or memoization cache to avoid redundant computations. Dynamic Programming is useful in solving optimization problems and problems with overlapping substructure.
