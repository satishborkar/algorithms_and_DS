Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used to solve problems by incrementally building candidates for a solution and backtracking when a candidate is determined to be invalid or does not lead to a valid solution. It is particularly useful for solving problems where the solution space is too large to explore exhaustively.

Here's a general outline of how backtracking algorithms work:

1. Initialization: Set up the problem, initialize data structures, and define the search space.

2. Candidate Generation: Generate a potential candidate for the solution at the current step. This involves making a choice or decision that moves the algorithm closer to the solution.

3. Feasibility Check: Determine if the candidate solution is feasible and satisfies the problem constraints or requirements. If the candidate is invalid, backtrack and explore other options.

4. Solution Check: Check if the candidate solution is a valid solution to the problem. If it is, store the solution or handle it according to the problem's requirements. If not, continue with the backtracking process.

5. Recursive Backtracking: Recursively repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining subproblems or steps until a valid solution is found or all possible candidates have been explored.

6. Backtracking: Undo the choice made in the previous step and explore alternative choices or candidates. This involves going back to a previous decision point and trying a different option.

7. Termination: Determine when to stop the algorithm. This could be when a specific condition is met, when a solution is found, or when all possible candidates have been explored.

Backtracking algorithms efficiently explore the solution space by incrementally building and exploring potential candidates. When an invalid or non-viable candidate is encountered, the algorithm backtracks and explores other options, avoiding unnecessary exploration of the search space.

Backtracking algorithms can be applied to various problems, including:

- N-Queens Problem: Determine all possible ways to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

- Sudoku: Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells with numbers 1 to 9, following Sudoku rules.

- Combination Sum: Find all unique combinations of numbers from a given array that sum up to a target value.

- Graph Coloring: Color the vertices of a graph using a minimum number of colors such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

- Hamiltonian Cycle: Find a closed loop in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once.

Implementing a backtracking algorithm typically involves using recursion to explore the solution space and maintaining appropriate data structures to track the current candidate and backtrack when necessary.

It's important to note that backtracking algorithms can have exponential time complexity, as the algorithm explores all possible candidates in the worst case. However, through pruning and intelligent candidate generation, the actual running time can often be significantly reduced.
