# Classification of Data Structures

- Linear Data Structures
  - Static Data Structures
    - Array
  - Dynamic Data Structures
    - Queue
    - Stack
    - Linked List
- Non-Linear Data Structures
  - Tree
  - Graph

In JavaScript, the built-in data structures include:

1. Array: An ordered collection of elements.
2. Object: An unordered collection of key-value pairs.
3. String: A sequence of characters.
4. Number: Represents numeric values.
5. Boolean: Represents either true or false.
6. Map: A collection of key-value pairs where the keys can be of any type.
7. Set: A collection of unique values of any type.
8. WeakMap: A collection of key-value pairs where the keys are weakly referenced.
9. WeakSet: A collection of unique values where the values are weakly referenced.
10. Symbol: A unique and immutable primitive value used as an identifier for object properties.
11. BigInt: A numeric primitive that can represent arbitrarily large integers.

Additionally, JavaScript also provides ways to implement and work with other data structures, such as:

12. Linked List: You can implement a linked list using objects or arrays in JavaScript.
13. Stack: You can implement a stack using arrays in JavaScript.
14. Queue: You can implement a queue using arrays or linked lists in JavaScript.
15. Tree: You can implement various tree structures, like binary trees, using objects or arrays in JavaScript.
16. Graph: You can implement graphs using objects or arrays, or use graph libraries for more complex operations.
17. Hash Table: You can create a hash table using objects in JavaScript.
18. Heap: You can implement heaps, like binary heaps, using arrays in JavaScript.
19. Trie: You can implement a trie data structure using objects or arrays in JavaScript.
20. Doubly Linked List: You can implement a doubly linked list using objects or arrays in JavaScript.

While JavaScript provides these basic data structures, there are also many third-party libraries and frameworks available that offer more specialized or advanced data structures and algorithms for specific use cases.
